## IBM Watson/Question Answering Systems

### What is IBM Watson?

#### Software
**Cognitive computing**: technology platforms based on artificial intelligence and signal processing, which encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural language processing, speech recognition and vision (object recognition), human–computer interaction, dialog and narrative generation.

Features of cognitive systems:
* **Adaptive**: They may learn as information changes, and as goals and requirements evolve. They may resolve ambiguity and tolerate unpredictability. They may be engineered to feed on dynamic data in real time, or near real time.
* **Interactive**: They may interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably. They may also interact with other processors, devices, and cloud services, as well as with people.
* **Iterative and stateful**: They may aid in defining a problem by asking questions or finding additional source input if a problem statement is ambiguous or incomplete. They may "remember" previous interactions in a process and return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time.
* **Contextual**: They may understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as meaning, syntax, time, location, appropriate domain, regulations, user’s profile, process, task and goal. They may draw on multiple sources of information, including both structured and unstructured digital information, as well as sensory inputs (visual, gestural, auditory, or sensor-provided).

Applications of cognitive systems:
* **Education**: e.g., an assistant that is personalized for each individual student.
* **Healthcare**: e.g., an assistant to evaluate information about the patient, looking through every medical record in depth, searching for indications that can be the source of their problems.

#### Hardware
**Cognitive computer**: it combines artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, in an approach which attempts to reproduce the behaviour of the human brain. e.g., a cognitive computer implemented by using neural networks and deep learning is provided by the IBM company's Watson machine. A subsequent development by IBM is the TrueNorth microchip architecture, which is designed to be closer in structure to the human brain than the von Neumann architecture used in conventional computers.
