### Knowledge Base in DL

* Each course is taught by at least one lecturer
* The course is taught on exactly two different days
* Each lecturer teaches at most one course every period
* Each course is on a set of topics
* Each course uses exactly one research methodology
* A course might be a prerequisite for a course
* A course is considered similar to another course if there is an overlap on topics and the same research methodology is used
* Topics are organized in a hierarchy, two topics could be disjoint or have overlaps
* A student might prefer (not) to take a course by a certain lecturer, or on a certain day, or on a certain topic
* At any given period, a student can take at least two and at most three courses
* A student cannot register for a course more than once
* A student can take a course only if she has taken the prerequisite
* When a student has an option between two courses that are equally preferable, the student would like to take a course that her friend takes
